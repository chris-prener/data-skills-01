## R and RStudio Basics

R is a programming language that is highly extensible and flexible - it can be adapted to work with everything from textual data to statistical and spatial data. [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) is a user interface for R that makes working with the language *much* easier. The first three features below that we'll discuss briefly are all aspects of RStudio - they are not part of the basic R releases.

### R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. I like to teach with notebooks, and use R Markdown more generally for statistical work when I want to start drafting both data/methods and results text.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk (a green right-facing arrow that is reminiscent of a play button).

```{r test-chunk}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar and choosing `R`. Notice that you can also with Python and SQL, among other languages.

When you save the notebook, an `html` file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it. The `html` file will always be saved in the directory that your R Markdown file is saved in. Other varieties of R Markdown files do not produce this `html` file automatically. You can save this file and then click on `data-skills-01.nb.html` in the file pane to see the latest rendered version.

If you want to create a new RMarkdown Notebook, you can do so by going to `File > New File > R Notebook`. There is a [basic guide to writing with Markdown here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). Finally, you should know that RStudio recently launched [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which is a second generation publishing platform that builds on RMarkdown.

For less involved projects, I often use an `R` script instead. These files can be created by going to `File > New File > R Script` and contain only code and comments. You can see an example of a very simple script in the `source/render.R` file.

### Saving Data

By default, RStudio wants to save the state of environment. I generally think this is not a good practice from a reproducibility standpoint. To disable, go to Preferences and then, under the Workspace section of the General tab on the left, un-check "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" and set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to "Never".

To find Preferences:

  * On macOS - go to `RStudio > Preferences...`
  * On Windows - go to `Tools > Global Options...`

### Using Themes

The Preferences panel also includes the option to change the appearance of your RStudio windows. Choose the Appearance tab on the left, and use the "Editor Theme" section to pick a different theme if you would like.

## Packages

Packages are the way that we can extend the base R software. They are typically written by R users and made available for free via a series of servers called CRAN.

To install new packages, we use the `install.packages()` function where the package name is written inside the parentheses in double quotes - "package name". This notebook requires a number of pre-installed packages, including `base`, `datasets`, and `utils`. These packages are already installed and loaded each time you open `R`. There were a few additional package that we needed to install and load. As a reminder, we used `install.packages()` to install CRAN packages:

```r
install.packages(c("cowsay", "palmerpenguins", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```

We almost always install packages from the Console instead of in our notebooks so that we don't unintentionally replace or break a key package in the middle of an analysis.

You should occasionally update packages when you are not in the middle of an important project using:

```r
update.packages()
```

You will have to type `y` or `Y` or `Yes` at each prompt.

With those packages installed, we'll start by loading our one package. Using new packages is a two-step process: first, you install the package, and then you load it using the `library()` function:

```{r load-packages}
library(cowsay)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

You only need to install `R` packages once using `install.packages()` per major release of `R`. When major releases happen, you can either move all of your packages over manually or simply start over by deleting your old libraries

At the beginning of each session / notebook, however, you will have to load them using the `library()` function. If you get the following error message, it means you need to use the `library()` function to load the package that your function is included in:

```{r eval=FALSE, error-example}
mutate()
```

So, in this case, we would need to load the package that the `mutate()` function is housed in.

It is possible to reference scripts in packages that have not been loaded by including the package name and two colons before the function:

```{r eval=FALSE, use-package-name}
dplyr::mutate()
```

## Load Data
After we load any packages we might need, our next task is going to be to load the data that we need. For now, this will mean loading data from a package, but in the next session we will look at importing data from several different sources (Excel and CSV). In the future, we can talk about reading from Snowflake.

### Scalar Objects
Data will be imported into an "object" - a name in your "environment" (essentially, in `R`'s memory) where it is held so that it can be referenced later. For example, we could make an object named `biocurator` and assign my name to it:

```{r create-bio}
biocurator <- "Chris"
```

You should now see the `biocurator` object in the `Environment` tab in RStudio! We can enter an object name by itself in the console to print its contents:

```{r print-bio}
biocurator
```

This is a **scalar** object because it contains a single data element.

Now you try - create an object named `colleague` and assign your name to it. After you create the object, print it:

```{r create-colleague}
colleague <- "Jane"
```

### Vector Objects
Technically, **scalars** are **vectors** who have a length of 1 (i.e. a single data element). Vectors can have any length (limited by your computer's memory, of course). We could store our packages for today in a vector, creating a list of names combined together using the `c()` function:

```{r create-pkg}
todays_packages <- c("cowsay", "palmerpenguins", "knitr", "rmarkdown")
```

Now you try - create a vector named `colleague` and assign a couple of our team members names to it:

```{r create-colleagues}
colleagues <- c("Jane", "John", "Jessica")
```

### Data Frames
We'll do the same thing this time, except we'll load some data from the `datasets` package. The `datasets` package comes pre-installed with `R` and contains a variety of fun and/or useful data sets. We'll load some data describing eruption intervals from the [Old Faithful geyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful):

```{r create-geyser}
geyser <- faithful
```

To explore the geyser data, we can use two functions. The first, `str()` or "structure", gives us a summary of its contents:

```{r explore-geyser}
str(geyser)
```

We've got two variables - one named `eruptions` and one named `waiting`. A **data frame** is a collection of vectors that all have the same length.

You can also click on the geyser object in the `Enviornment` tab to open up the same spreadsheet view of the data.

Now, you try. There is also a data set called `penguins` in the `palmerpenguins` package. Assign it to a new object called `penguin` and use the `str()` function to explore its contents:

```{r}
# load data
penguin <- penguins

# explore
str(penguin)
```

The `#` symbol is how we comment out lines in `R`. I like to use it liberally to leave notes to myself about the purposes of specific blocks of code.

## Working with Functions
So far, all of the functions that we have used have taken a single argument in the parentheses:

```r
install.packages("cowsay")
str(geyser)
View(geyser)
```

Function calls can be made more complex in two ways. First, functions can be *nested* within each other. For instance, if we want to generate a list of the animals included in `cowsay`, we could try to print the `animals` object. It is quite messy, so we won't do it in the notebook, but you can try in the console if you'd like:

```r
animals
```

To extract just the names, we can use the `names()` function:

```{r list-names}
names(animals)
```

This is great, but it would be better if it were presented in alphabetical order, so we'll *wrap* the `names(animals)` function call in the `sort()` function:

```{r list-names-alpha}
sort(names(animals))
```

`R` functions are endlessly nest-able, but you should do this with caution - the more times you nest within a function, the harder it becomes to read and de-bug!

The second way we can extend functions is by specifying multiple arguments:

```{r say-meow}
say(what = "gobble gobble", by = "turkey")
```

Parameters like `what` and `by` give a function specific pieces of information. Always name the parameters - it makes your function easier to debug and more explicit!

Now, your turn. Pick a new animal and give it its own message:

```{r create-animal}
say(what = "do or do not, there is no try", by = "yoda")
```

## Getting Help

If you want to get help from within `R`, there are two easy way to bring up documentation files in the `Help` tab in the lower right-hand corner. The first is the single question mark, which can be used with a package name:

```{r help-package}
?base
```

The single question mark can also be used with a function name:

```{r help-function}
?install.packages
```

If you don't find what you need, or a package/function does not have help files created for you, you can use the double question mark operator to search for additional resources:

```{r help-search}
??cowsay
```

Now, you try getting help for the `palmerpenguins` package:

```{r help-datasets}
?palmerpenguins
```

There are other great resources for getting help, such as the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com) and Hadley Wickham's [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) book. Package websites often have tutorials, called vignettes, as well. For example, [here is the introductory vignette for the `palmerpenguins` package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).

## R Projects and Working Directories
R Projects are a special type of file associated with RStudio. They create self-contained directories and environments that increase the reproducibility of your work. They also take care of managing the working directory for you. The working directory is an often difficult to grasp concept at first. Think of it as a postal address - this is where `R` will expect all information to come from and go to about a project. You can view the current working directory with `getwd()`:

```{r check-wd}
getwd()
```

R projects create a home for your analyses. When you set a R project up, it will change the **working directory** to the project's directory. This means that all of the data you save from RStudio will be saved there by default. It also means that you can open files saved in that directory without needing to worry about file paths.

R projects can also help you navigate a wrinkle with `.Rmd` files, which automatically recognize the folder they reside in as the working directory. We'll talk more about this next time!

We'll give you an R project directory to download for each session. However, if you want to create a new project for your own work, go to `File > New Project...` and follow the prompts. You can create a new project directory, associate a project with an existing directory, and even add `git` version control if you know how to use it!
